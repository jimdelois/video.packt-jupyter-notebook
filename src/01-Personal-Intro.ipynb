    "# My Personal Introductory Chapter to Jupyter Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the purpose of this repository is to store the code related to PacktPub's \"Jupyter Notebook for Data Science [Video],\" it also serves as a place to store personal revelations and experiments of my own as I learn this technology for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Information\n",
    "The primary course followed here, as mentioned above, is \"Jupyter Notebook for Data Science [Video],\" available as a video series from PacktPub. The course content is [available here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Jupyter-Notebook-for-Data-Science).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Setup Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The course, itself, recommends using Jupyter from within a Docker container, which I obviously enjoy. I immediately thought it pertinent to also install other numeric computing and analysis libraries, such as Octve, etc. We shall briefly discuss that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point, the Course recommends using `jupyter/datascience-notebook`, so we install that trivially. However, it is also worth understanding the entirety of the [Jupyter Docker Ecosystem](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html) to clarify the intentions and relationship of each available image.  That previous link describes each of the available Jupyter-sanctioned Docker images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General\n",
    "The default instructions often suggest adding a volume into the container's location of `/usr/jovyan`.  However, mounting such a directory to that location from one's local means that there will be an array of OS-specific and domain-irrelevant files mounted back into the host machine's folders.  Think, `.bash_profile` or `.octaverc` or even the `.jovyan` directory.  This creates a great deal of unnecessary clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image built as part of my repository exploits the fact that there is already a blank directory in the image's default user's home directory, called `work`. We then choose to mount all Jupyter-related files into that directory, and use Docker's build process to mount or edit anything else in the original image-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository's `Dockerfile` is fairly self-explanatory within this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personal Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as documenting some of the deterministic ways of using the program, we look at a few of the subjective and personal excitements encountered along the way, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Revelations\n",
    "This section really just proves that Markdown is supported, as well as pointing out that there are many, many other kernels available for Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown\n",
    "So, yeah, Markdown is supported within all of Jupyter by default.  Here is an example of an `inline code snippet`, and here's one of a\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Miscellaneous Code Block.\n",
    "```\n",
    "And yet is here another, this time with specified syntax highlighting...\n",
    "```php\n",
    "<?\n",
    "    class MyStuff {\n",
    "        private \\Baloney $baloney;\n",
    "\n",
    "        function __construct(\\Baloney $b) {\n",
    "            $this->baloney = $b;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "?>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note also that, because of this, tables-of-contents may be generated and whatnot, as well.  I suspect that there may also be a way to \"bind\" multiple Jupyter Notebooks together and publish them as one single document automatically... However I have not yet learned of any such feature as of this writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LaTeX...\n",
    "It was not until actually playing with Jupyter's Markdown support that I learned that Markdown, by default, supports $\\LaTeX$ markup. Pretty impressive!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I am in Markdown now, and can provide this as an inline formula: $x(x-1) = 7$. This happens also to be a factorization of this block-level version of the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^2-x = 7\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Jupyter Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Xeus Octave - An Improved Solution\n",
    "There is [an alternative Octave Kernel](https://xeus-octave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) which may offer better performace (as it does not rely on a standalone Octave executable but, instead, works natively at a lower level. It also includes its own two graphics toolkits, one of which is a [Plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/) integration (experimental) that seems to offer some fairly impressive visualization outputs.\n",
