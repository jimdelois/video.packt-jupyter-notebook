    "# My Personal Introductory Chapter to Jupyter Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the purpose of this repository is to store the code related to PacktPub's \"Jupyter Notebook for Data Science [Video],\" it also serves as a place to store personal revelations and experiments of my own as I learn this technology for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Information\n",
    "The primary course followed here, as mentioned above, is \"Jupyter Notebook for Data Science [Video],\" available as a video series from PacktPub. The course content is [available here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Jupyter-Notebook-for-Data-Science).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Setup Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The course, itself, recommends using Jupyter from within a Docker container, which I obviously enjoy. I immediately thought it pertinent to also install other numeric computing and analysis libraries, such as Octve, etc. We shall briefly discuss that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point, the Course recommends using `jupyter/datascience-notebook`, so we install that trivially. However, it is also worth understanding the entirety of the [Jupyter Docker Ecosystem](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html) to clarify the intentions and relationship of each available image.  That previous link describes each of the available Jupyter-sanctioned Docker images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General\n",
    "The default instructions often suggest adding a volume into the container's location of `/usr/jovyan`.  However, mounting such a directory to that location from one's local means that there will be an array of OS-specific and domain-irrelevant files mounted back into the host machine's folders.  Think, `.bash_profile` or `.octaverc` or even the `.jovyan` directory.  This creates a great deal of unnecessary clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image built as part of my repository exploits the fact that there is already a blank directory in the image's default user's home directory, called `work`. We then choose to mount all Jupyter-related files into that directory, and use Docker's build process to mount or edit anything else in the original image-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository's `Dockerfile` is fairly self-explanatory within this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Octave\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Octave as an `apt-get` package is simple, but configuring it to work correctly in the context of being bridged to Jupyter via the `jupyter-octave` plugin requires a small amount of tweaking.  The `Dockerfile` in this library has suffered several iterations before being deemed correct and usable.  General documentation of a \"Dockerized Jupyter with Octave Kernels\" is woefully absent, so this endeavor has been mostly trial-and-error.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many issues regarding the fact that `octave-cli` (which is the library invoked by Jupyter's Octave kernal) cannot use the `qt` graphics engine within a container, even though the `qt` engine has been declared the new default.  While the `octave` GUI executable is fully-capable of supporting `qt`, the CLI is not, and still relies on `gnuplot`.  Upon any default usage of the Octave Kernel within Jupyter, a warning will be displayed saying that `gnuplot` should be abandoned in favor of `qt`, even though the Dockerized version of these libraries does not come together easily.  This repository is the current result of any trial-and-error remnants that might make the `qt` library work for the CLI invocation (and there are examples online of simply mapping the CLI version to the full-blown GUI executable, but specifying `--no-gui` when launching).  This explains the mounting of the `.otaverc` file, the explicit installation of `gnuplot-qt`, and even the fact that we re-add `conda-forge` as early as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, any related changes to the parent image in support of Octave should be self-evident in this repository's local `Dockerfile`.\n",

    "## Personal Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as documenting some of the deterministic ways of using the program, we look at a few of the subjective and personal excitements encountered along the way, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Revelations\n",
    "This section really just proves that Markdown is supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown\n",
    "So, yeah, Markdown is supported within all of Jupyter by default.  Here is an example of an `inline code snippet`, and here's one of a\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Miscellaneous Code Block.\n",
    "```\n",
    "And yet is here another, this time with specified syntax highlighting...\n",
    "```php\n",
    "<?\n",
    "    class MyStuff {\n",
    "        private \\Baloney $baloney;\n",
    "\n",
    "        function __construct(\\Baloney $b) {\n",
    "            $this->baloney = $b;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "?>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note also that, because of this, tables-of-contents may be generated and whatnot, as well.  I suspect that there may also be a way to \"bind\" multiple Jupyter Notebooks together and publish them as one single document automatically... However I have not yet learned of any such feature as of this writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LaTeX...\n",
    "It was not until actually playing with Jupyter's Markdown support that I learned that Markdown, by default, supports $\\LaTeX$ markup. Pretty impressive!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I am in Markdown now, and can provide this as an inline formula: $x(x-1) = 7$. This happens also to be a factorization of this block-level version of the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^2-x = 7\n",
